# Health Plan Cost Optimization - Exploratory Analysis and Linear Regression

This repository contains an analysis of health plan cost optimization in a company in the food industry. The analysis was conducted using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and StatsModels.

## Context

A company in the food industry is experiencing an increase in health plan costs for its employees. The analysis aims to understand the factors contributing to this increase and propose preventive actions to reduce costs.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the employee profile and identify possible patterns.
- Evaluate the relationship between personal characteristics (age, BMI, number of children, smoking) and health plan costs.
- Propose preventive actions based on the analysis results.

## Repository Contents

- `Health_Plan_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, including data visualizations, frequency tables, statistical summaries, and interpretations.
- `health_plan_data.csv`: The dataset used in the analysis.

## Results and Insights

- Through exploratory analysis, we observe that the majority of employees fall within the age range of 30 to 40 years and have up to two children.
- Correlation analysis and multiple linear regression indicate that age, BMI, number of children, and smoking habits (or lack thereof) are related to health plan costs.
- Preventive actions could include promoting healthy habits, smoking cessation programs, and employee well-being initiatives.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Health_Plan_Analysis.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment.
3. Execute the notebook cells to reproduce the analyses and visualizations.
