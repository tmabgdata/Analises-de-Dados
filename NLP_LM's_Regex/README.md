# Language Detection Project

This project aims to detect languages in text data by utilizing regular expressions (regex) and machine learning models. The focus is on cleaning and processing StackOverflow data for language analysis.

## Overview

The Language Detection Project processes a dataset of text samples (in this case, from StackOverflow) and performs language identification using a combination of regular expressions and machine learning algorithms. The data is cleaned, pre-processed, and analyzed to detect the language of various pieces of code or textual input.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Removing unnecessary characters, HTML tags, and correcting fragmented words such as "c code" and "s ql".
- **Language Detection**: Using regex patterns and machine learning models to classify text data into languages.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and structure the data for easy analysis and training.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for training machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Employed to clean fragmented words and patterns within the text.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collection of StackOverflow data for language processing.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of HTML tags, punctuation, digits, and correction of fragmented words.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Standardization of text (lowercasing, removal of extra spaces/newlines).
4. **Model Training**: A machine learning model is trained to classify the language of the cleaned text data.
5. **Testing and Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated for its accuracy and effectiveness in detecting languages.

## Usage

### Setup

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-detection.git
cd language-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis

To start the analysis, simply run the provided Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook language_detection.ipynb
```

### Data Files

The following data files are used in the project:

- `raw_data.csv`: The original dataset collected from StackOverflow.
- `cleaned_data.csv`: The cleaned and pre-processed dataset ready for language detection.
- `output_results.csv`: The results of the language detection model.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates an effective approach to language detection using both regex and machine learning models. The data cleaning and preprocessing steps are critical for preparing the text data, which is then classified into different languages with reasonable accuracy.
