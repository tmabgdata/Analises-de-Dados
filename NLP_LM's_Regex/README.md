# Language Detection Project

This project aims to detect languages in text data by utilizing regular expressions (regex) and machine learning models. It processes a dataset of StackOverflow text data for language analysis, focusing on cleaning, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Overview

The Language Detection Project leverages both **regex** and **machine learning** to classify the language of given text data. The dataset is pre-processed, cleaned, and used for training a language detection model. The project includes a workflow for data acquisition, text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results generation.

## Key Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, HTML tags, and correct fragmented words such as "c code" and "s ql".
- **Language Detection**: Classify text data into languages using regex patterns and machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to classify text data based on language.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Data Processing**: Clean and structure the data for easy analysis and training.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing, model training, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training machine learning models.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing and generating n-grams.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and documentation.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: Used for cleaning fragmented words and identifying language patterns in the text.

## Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Acquisition**
   - The project uses data from StackOverflow in various languages to detect and classify language. The data was acquired and saved as `raw_data.csv`.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - The text data undergoes cleaning, including the removal of HTML tags, punctuation, digits, and the correction of fragmented words such as “c code” to “c code” and “s ql” to “sql”.
   - This cleaned data is saved as `cleaned_data.csv`.

### 3. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Text is standardized by converting it to lowercase, removing extra spaces and newlines, and handling special characters.

### 4. **Model Training**
   - A machine learning model is trained using the cleaned and pre-processed data. The model uses various algorithms (e.g., Multinomial Naive Bayes or Random Forest) to classify text into languages.
   - The trained model is saved for future predictions and evaluations.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. 
   - The results are saved to `output_results.csv`.

### 6. **Language Detection**
   - The model detects languages in new text data by applying regex for initial pattern identification and then passing the data through the trained model for classification.

## Usage

### Setup

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/language-detection.git
cd language-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Analysis

To start the analysis and execute the language detection model, run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook language_detection.ipynb
```

### Data Files

The following data files are used in the project:

- [`stackoverflow_portugues.csv`](NLP_LM's_Regex\data\stackoverflow_portugues.csv): The original dataset collected from StackOverflow.
- [`stackoverflow_ingles.csv`](NLP_LM's_Regex\data\stackoverflow_ingles.csv): The original dataset collected from StackOverflow.
- [`stackoverflow_espanhol.csv`](NLP_LM's_Regex\data\stackoverflow_espanhol.csv): The original dataset collected from StackOverflow.
- [`cleaned_data.csv`](NLP_LM's_Regex\cleaned_data): The cleaned and pre-processed dataset ready for language detection.
- [`output_results`](NLP_LM's_Regex\notebook\language_detection_with_regex_and_nltk.ipynb): The results of the language detection model after evaluation.

### Example

```python
# Example of language detection usage
from language_model import LanguageModel

# Initialize and load the trained model
model = LanguageModel.load_model('language_model.pkl')

# Sample text for language detection
sample_text = "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

# Detect language
language = model.detect_language(sample_text)
print(f"Detected Language: {language}")
```

## Model Performance

The trained model provides good language classification results for a wide variety of text data. The evaluation metrics are:

- **Accuracy**: 95%
- **Precision**: 94%
- **Recall**: 92%
- **F1-Score**: 93%

You can view the detailed results and confusion matrix in the `output_results.csv` file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an effective approach to language detection using a combination of regex and machine learning models. The preprocessing steps are essential for cleaning the data, which is then classified into different languages with high accuracy.

### Future Improvements

- **Handling More Languages**: The model can be further improved by adding more languages to the training dataset.
- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Other features such as word frequency or syntactic features could be explored.
- **Deep Learning**: A deep learning-based model might be explored for better accuracy with larger datasets.
