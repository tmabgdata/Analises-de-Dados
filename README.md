## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects, follow the instructions provided in the respective project folders. Each project includes a detailed README file with setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples.

## Prerequisites

Before running any of the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook (for notebook-based projects)
- Streamlit (for Streamlit-based projects)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tmabgdata/Data-Science.git
cd Data-Science
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Projects

### Streamlit Projects

For projects using Streamlit, navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser at the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) to interact with the app.

### Jupyter Notebook Projects

For projects using Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the project folder and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
